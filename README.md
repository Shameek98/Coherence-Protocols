# Coherence-Protocols
Modelled a 4 processor system with bus-based coherence and compared different coherence protocol optimizations for the four peer caches. Implemented MSI(without BusUpgr), MSI(with BusUpgr), MESI, and Snoop Filter and evaluated the effects of coherence optimizations on the amount of cache-to-cache transfers.
